Computes the probability that two segments y(i+1:i+m+k) and y(j+1:j+m+k) have Chebychev distance < r*std(y, 1) given the fact that y(i+1:i+m) and y(j+1:j+m) have Chebychev distance < r*std(y, 1). Specifying a value for d gives the multiscale version. This implementation requires the creation of a length(y)*(length(y)-1)/2 dimensional vector.
